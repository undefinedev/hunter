Notes
-----

Since v0.0.0-80c8f6a-p0, most stb libraries in Hunter (excluding stb_textedit and stb_tilemap_editor) have implementations built inside the Hunter package and downstream consumers use header files that do NOT respect the stb _IMPLEMENTATION flags. This is to ensure a single version of the stb libraries is built.
